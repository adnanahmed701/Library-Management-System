# Library-Management-System
Library Management System in C

## Function
The code implements a menu-driven Library Management System, allowing users to add/view books, remove books, and issue/track book loans to students.

File handling operations are used to store and manage book and student information persistently in separate files ("books.txt" and "issue.txt").

Date handling captures the current date when adding or issuing books, and basic input validation ensures the existence of a book before issuing it to a student, though safer input functions are recommended.
